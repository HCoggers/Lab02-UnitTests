# ATMs and Unit Tests!
__Lab-02-UnitTests for .Net 401
by Harry Cogswell__

## Summary
This is a C# Application that mimics the functions of a basic ATM. You have the options to withdraw money, deposit money, or view your balance. You will start with a default balance of $5,000 whenever you open the app, and can continue to add or take from it until you decide to leave the app.

## Directions
1. In order to install this app and try it for yourself, clone this repo using  
   `git clone https://github.com/HCoggers/Lab02-UnitTests.git`

2. Then open *./Lab02-UnitTests/Lab02-UnitTests.sln* within Visual Studio 

3. Run the solution from Visual Studio and you're golden!

### Furthermore
Keep in mind that as the user, you cannot remove more than your balance, nor can you withdraw or deposit negative amounts.  
In the future, I would like to develop a receipt feature that will print out every transaction you made in a session before you leave the app.
